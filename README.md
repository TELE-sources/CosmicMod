# CosmicMod
CosmicMod Gnu/Linux a Gentoo based distro optimized for the latest hardware and KDE Plasma Desktop

This code repo only has information for building the disk image which is not necessary to utilize CosmicMod as it is already built and available in the releases section of the Wiki to download and install.  This cuts the installation time down from up to a week for building and compiling the image to just a few minutes by simply copy over a disk image and configure a few things.  

See the Wiki section for most of the useful and relavant information for utilizing CosmicMod GNU/Linux.
